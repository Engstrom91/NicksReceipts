I built this Spring MVC application to be able to demonstrate how the Swedish public health insurance works. 
Using this service, healthcare workers would be able to view a patient's prescriptions and decide which of their costs should be covered by the insurance.

The data for each patient is stored in a MySQL table which is accessed through the application's Spring repository. 
I developed a Controller class that returns relevant views to be rendered in the browser. The frontend was built using Thymeleaf.
